/**
 * 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
 * <p>
 * You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
 * <p>
 * struct Node {
 * int val;
 * Node *left;
 * Node *right;
 * Node *next;
 * }
 * <p>
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}
 * <p>
 * Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1. You may only use constant extra space.
 * 2. Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
